\chapter{Introduction}
The problem given is to sort an array containing the characters `A', `M', and `T',
 such that all the $T's$ appear first, followed by all the $A's$, and lastly all the $M's$.
Special constraints are in place to make this sort harder:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{-Constraint 1:} Each letter (`A', `M', or `T') is evaluated \textbf{only once}.\\
\textbf{-Constraint 2:} The function $SWAP(TAM,i,j)$ is \textbf{used only} when it is \textbf{necessary}.\\
\textbf{-Constraint 3: No extra space} can be used by the algorithm $Sort\_TAM$. In other words,
\textbf{only} the array TAMUK can be used to sort the `A', `M', or `T'.\\
\textbf{-Constraint 4:} You \textbf{cannot count} the number of each letter `A', `M', or `T'.
\end{quote}
There is some ambiguity with contraints 2 and 3. 
One interpretation of constraint 2 is that only the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the array is allowed.
However, I will show in \autoref{chapter:design} that if this interpretation is followed, 
then constraint 3 will be violated, 
namely significantly more space is required to figure out the minimum amount of swaps.
Therefore, my interpretation of constraint 2 is 
that swaps will only be used if the two letters being swapped are not the same.
My interpretation of constraint 3 is that primitive data structures such as integers are allowed (such as indexing variables),
 just not something like bigger like arrays. The main algorithm used is a type of insertion sort, and the programming language used to implement is is Python.
\chapter{Design}
\label{chapter:design}
First I will show the algorithm in pseudocode and then give a short example of how it works.
Here is the pseudocode:
\begin{verbatim}
procedure Sort_TAM(TAMUK: arrayChar);
    var
        a, m, i: integer;
    begin
        a := -1;
        m := -1;
        for i:=0 to n-1 do
            if TAMUK[i] = 'T' then
                if a > -1 then
                    SWAP(TAMUK, a, i);
                    a := a + 1;
                else if m > -1 then
                    SWAP(TAMUK, m, i);
                    m := m + 1;
            if TAMUK[i] = 'A' then
                if m > -1 then
                    SWAP(TAMUK, m, i);
                    if a = -1 then
                        a := m;
                    m := m + 1;
                else if a = -1 then
                    a := i;
            if TAMUK[i] = 'M' then
                if m = -1 then
                    m := i;
    end;
\end{verbatim}

Suppose the given character array, $TAMUK$, is given as below:\\\\

    \draw [<->] (t2) to [bend right]node[above left]{$6$} (m2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\\We evaluate $TAMUK[5]$: $a=2$ and $m=4$.\\\\
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth]

    \node[rec] (m1) at (8,0) {M};
    \node[rec] (m2) at (10,0) {M};
\end{tikzpicture}
\\The final sorted array. 
Notice that there were 6 swap operations (indicated by the number on the directed edges).
This is not the optimal/minimum number of swaps to sort the array.
Instead, the optimal is shown below:\\
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth]
    \node[rec] (m1) at (0,0) {M};
    \node[rec] (m2) at (2,0) {M};
    \node[rec] (a1) at (4,0) {A};
    \node[rec] (a2) at (6,0) {A};
    \node[rec] (t1) at (8,0) {T};
    \node[rec] (t2) at (10,0) {T};
    \draw [<->] (t1) to [bend right=20]node[above]{$1'$} (m1);
    \draw [<->] (t2) to [bend right=20]node[above left]{$2'$} (m2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\pagebreak
\\This optimal can be achieved by noticing that the swap operations are composible.
Notice that the composition of swap 1, swap 3, and swap 4 is equivalent to swap $1'$, since `A' starts and ends up at $TAMUK[2]$, `M' starts at $TAMUK[0]$ and ends up at $TAMUK[4]$, and `T' starts at $TAMUK[4]$ and ends up at $TAMUK[0]$.
Similarly swap $2'$ is equivalent to the composition of swap 2, 5, and 6. Finding the minimal swap then becomes finding cycles in a graph. Unfortunately, we would then need to store the swaps as edges between vertices (which will be on the same order of magnitude as the array itself), violating constraint 3.
